Hi, I'm Matt. I'm from Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and I graduated from Penn State University in 2017 with a degree in Industrial Engineering. With the exception of one introductory computer science course during my undergraduate studies, I am an almost entirely self-taught programmer. Check out my portfolio to learn more about some of the cool stuff I've worked on!

I am currently looking for a full-time opportunity to continue to learn and grow as a software developer. Starting in January 2020, I will also be pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science through Oregon State University's online [postbaccalauerate degree program](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc). Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions!
